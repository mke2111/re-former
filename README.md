# Forms re-former

> In this project, we created different versions of forms using various methods like form_tag, form_for and vanilla HTML form in the views file, both for creating a new form and updating an existing form.<br>
> To achieve this, we generated a user model and a users controller with the sqlite3 being used for storage.<br>
> All the form fields have the necessary validations required to check the user input.
